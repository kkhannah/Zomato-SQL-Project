```sql

CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;

```

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

## Business Problems

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

```sql

WITH dish_cte AS

	(SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.customer_name,
		o.order_item as dishes,
		COUNT(*) as total_orders,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rank
	FROM orders as o
	JOIN
	customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	WHERE 
		o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 Year'
		AND 
		c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
	GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, dishes)
	
SELECT 
	customer_name,
	dishes,
	total_orders
FROM dish_cte
WHERE rank <= 5;

```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed, based on 2-hour intervals.

**Approach 1:**

```sql

-- Approach 1

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00 - 14:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00 - 16:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slot,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

```

**Approach 2:**

```sql

SELECT 
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 as start_time,
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 + 2 as end_time,
	COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY start_time, end_time
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value).

```sql

SELECT 
	c.customer_name,
	ROUND(AVG(o.total_amount),2) as aov
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY o.customer_id,c.customer_name
HAVING  COUNT(*) > 750;

```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name and customer_id.

```sql

SELECT
	c.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,
	SUM(o.total_amount) as total_sum
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id,c.customer_name
HAVING  SUM(o.total_amount)> 100000
ORDER BY total_sum DESC;

```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery

FROM orders as o
LEFT JOIN 
restaurants as r
ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
LEFT JOIN
